# Horiseon Website - Code Refactoring for Accessibility


## Description
 This respository holds an exercise project in creating a website that is accessible for all. The aim of the project was to utlise HTML and CSS semantically to create a webpage experience that can be visited and used by anyone and optimise it for search engines.

 ###Features
    - Has semantic HTML and CSS
    - Meets accessiblity standards
    - Accessible alt attributes for all image tags
    - Fully functional features
    

 Key take-aways from this project are:   
    - "alt" attribute text needs to be descriptive enough without being excessive.  
    - Emoji's need to be appropriately tagged for a screen reader to observe.  
    - Colour ratio is an important factor in selecting colourways for any element of a webpage.  

Below is a screengrab of the full webpage:
