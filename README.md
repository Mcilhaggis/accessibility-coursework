# accessibility_coursework


## Description (add screenshot)
 This project is an exercise in creating a website that is accessible for all. Utilisng HTML and CSS semantically to create a webpage experience that can be visited and used by anyone.

 Key take-aways from this project are:   
    * "alt" attribute text needs to be descriptive enough without being excessive.  
    * Emoji's need to be appropriately tagged for a screen reader to observe.  
    * Colour ratio is an important factor in selecting colourways for any element of a webpage.  

Below is a screengrab of the entire webpage.
